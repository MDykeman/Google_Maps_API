  <h1>How To: Plot Custom Makrers on the Google Maps</h1>

  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>
    One of the most important things to be able to do while using the Google Maps API is to tell users where locations are on the Google Map.
  </p>

  <p>This page will be dedicated to showing how to plot markers onto a Google Map and creating your own custom markers!</p>

  <h2>How to Plot a Marker using the Google Maps API</h2>

  <p>
    In the same Google Maps JavaScript file that you used to set up and display your google map on your page place this code.

    <span>
      function initialize() {
        var myLatlng = new google.maps.LatLng(-25.363882,131.044922);
        var mapOptions = {
          zoom: 4,
          center: myLatlng
        }
        var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map-canvas'), mapOptions);

        var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
            position: myLatlng,
            map: map,
            title: 'Hello World!'
        });
    }
      });
    </span>
  </p>

<h3>Quick Reminder</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The initialize function allows you to display the Google map on your page</li>
  <li>The map variable tells the Google Maps Api where to place the Google Map on your html page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now lets get to the marker variable.This as you may have guessed is how we create a marker to place in your Google Maps API.</p>

<p>First of all to access the Marker Object through the API you will have to type "new google.maps.Marker". This will create a new Google Maps marker object. This lets you access all of the properties you need to have set up and customize your Google Maps API Marker.</p>

<p>There are two <u>KEY</u> properties That are very important when you are making a marker. position and map</p>

<ul>
  <li>Position: Lets you tell the google maps api where to place the marker on your map. This must be in Longitude and Lattitude. *This is a required property</li>
  <li>Map: This tells the Api which map your marker will display on. Without this property your marker will not be displayed on your google map.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding a Marker After you have created a Map</h2>

<p>
  But what if you want to place a marker on your map after the map has been loaded to the page? Not to fret we can to that too!
</p>

<p>
  After you have created the marker for your map you can assign it to a map after it has been loaded using the "marker.setMap(map);" method. All this is doing is telling your marker variable to be added to a google map in this instance it is being added to the google map in the variable "map". Which is why map is found within the parenthesis.
