  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>
    One of the most important things to be able to do while using the Google Maps API is to tell users where locations are on the Google Map.
  </p>

  <p>This page will be dedicated to showing how to plot markers onto a Google Map and creating your own custom markers!</p>

  <h2>How to Plot a Marker using the Google Maps API</h2>

  <p>
    In the same Google Maps JavaScript file that you used to set up and display your google map on your page place this code.</p>

    <div class="code">
        <p>
      function initialize() {<br />
        var myLatlng = new google.maps.LatLng(-25.363882,131.044922);<br />
        var mapOptions = {<br />
          zoom: 4,<br />
          center: myLatlng<br />
        }<br /><br />
        var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map-canvas'), mapOptions);<br />
<br />
        var marker = new google.maps.Marker({<br />
            position: myLatlng,<br />
            map: map,<br />
            title: 'Hello World!'<br />
        });<br />
    }<br />
      });</p>
    </div>
  
<div class="reminder" >
<h3>Quick Reminder</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The initialize function allows you to display the Google map on your page</li>
  <li>The map variable tells the Google Maps Api where to place the Google Map on your html page.</li>
</ul>
</div>
    
<p>Now lets get to the marker variable.This as you may have guessed is how we create a marker to place in your Google Maps API.</p>

<p>First of all to access the Marker Object through the API you will have to type "new google.maps.Marker". This will create a new Google Maps marker object. This lets you access all of the properties you need to have set up and customize your Google Maps API Marker.</p>

    <div class='reminder' >
    <h2>There are two KEY</h2><p> properties That are very important when you are making a marker. position and map</p>

<ul>
  <li>Position: Lets you tell the google maps api where to place the marker on your map. This must be in Longitude and Lattitude. *This is a required property</li>
  <li>Map: This tells the Api which map your marker will display on. Without this property your marker will not be displayed on your google map.</li>
</ul></div>

<h2>Adding a Marker After you have created a Map</h2>

<p>
  But what if you want to place a marker on your map after the map has been loaded to the page? Not to fret we can to that too!
</p>

<p>
  After you have created the marker for your map you can assign it to a map after it has been loaded using the "marker.setMap(map);" method. All this is doing is telling your marker variable to be added to a google map in this instance it is being added to the google map in the variable "map". Which is why map is found within the parenthesis.
</p>

<h2>Remove a Marker</h2>

<p>If you would like to remove a marker that you haveplaced on a google map then you can simple enter "marker.setMap(null)" after you have set a marker on a map.</p>

<p>It is important to not that this doens not delete the marker but rather it removes the marker from being placed in your google map. Although this is good information for you to know as the developer the user will be none the wiser.</p>


<h2>How to create a custom Marker</h2>

<p>
  In order to make your google maps API super fancy you can switch the typical marker icon with a custom marker that you have created!.
</p>

<p>Adding an image to customize your google maps marker is pretty simple. If you were able to have your google maps makrer display on your Google Map then you can also add a Simple Icon to replace the marker!</p>

<p>In order to replace the regular marker icon all you have to do is tell the API where the Image in located that you would like to use. and in the marker object set the icon to the variable name you gave your image.</p>

<div class="code" >
    <p>
  var image = 'images/happyface.jpg';<br />
  var myLatLng = new google.maps.LatLng(-33.890542, 151.274856);<br />
  var marker = new google.maps.Marker({<br />
      position: myLatLng,<br />
      map: map,<br />
      icon: image<br />
  });
</p></div>

<p>That is all that you have to do inorder to change the default icon to the a custom image. Once the "icon" property is set to your image the Google Maps API will do all the work necesarry to resize the image so you don't have a massive image where your marker should be!</p>

<p>That's all there is! There are plenty of other cool things that the google Maps API can do tho. It doens't stop at set markers on a map and making custom map markers. That's only the beginning!
